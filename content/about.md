## My Story
I am a junior at Washington and Lee University, currently working towards a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a minor in Russian Language and Culture Studies.  I am also a running back and captain on the Washington and Lee football team.

When I have a some free time, I love to be outdoors, hanging out with friends.  I enjoy going to the beach while at my home in Virginia Beach and hiking in the mountains near Lexington while at school, a passion that was engrained in me from my time spent earning the rank of Eagle Scout.  I also love music.  For the past two years I have had the awesome opportunity to be a DJ on my school's radio station, WLUR, where you can find me one night a week on my show, _The Sound_.
