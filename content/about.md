## My Story
I am currently a junior at Washington and Lee University, currently working towards a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a minor in Russian Language and Culture Studies.  I am also a captain on the Washington and Lee football team.

When I have some free time, I love to be outdoors, hanging out with friends.  When at my home in Virginia Beach, it doesn't get much better than a day on the beach or at the bay.  Back at school, I swap my flip-flops for hiking boots, enjoying the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Hiking is a pasttime picked up from my time spent earning the rank of Eagle Scout and one that has stuck with me ever since.  I also love music.  For the past two years I have had the priveledge of being a DJ for my school's radio station, WLUR.  One night each week I run my own show, _The Sound_, where I feature some my favorite songs.
