This project is a particular source of pride for myself because of its practicality and usefulness.

As a running back, running sprints are particularly important in my training.  But, running the same set distances over and over is not only boring, but also not exactly the best training, as during a play I could run anywhere from five to 100 yards (I don't train to get tackled for a loss).  So, in order to attempt to simulate the randomness of the game of football, the idea of the Sprint Generator came into mind.

As you can see in the code, Sprint Generator takes your input of the number of sprints you would like to run, and generates a random number for each one, choosing a distance for each one that is determined by preset percentages.  It then prints out the total distance you will run, along with how many of each distance category of sprint will be run.

I am looking to add a few more features to Sprint Generator soon, such as footwork exercises or broad jumps, to try and extend the workout that can be provided by the app.
