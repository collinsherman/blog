These were fun projects because they was my first true collaborative project.  My team of four students, including myself, were put together and tasked with developing these two apps, with only a little bit of starter code from our professor.  I was the Git Repo Manager and focused on the display side of the projects, though we all worked on the backend coding to varying degrees.

The War app (pictured above) was a challenge at first, as we could not get our two "player" objects to work correctly.  But, after several hours of searching and testing, we were able to figure out the problem and eventually have the game fully functional and running well.

The FreeCell game (similar to Solitaire; pictured on portfolio home page) was a large project in and of itself, but our previous experience building the War game was very helpful.  We were able to get through the algorithms required for the playing of the game pretty easily, albeit with a few hiccups, but the display of these moves proved to be a bit trickier.  Again, though, our perserverance allowed us to work out the kinks and produce a fully functional version of FreeCell.
