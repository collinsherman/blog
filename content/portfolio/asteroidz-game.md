After a couple of low-level, intro projects into Android App development, my partner and I were given two weeks to develop an app of our own.  Through some trial and error, we settled on a game (that we later dubbed _Asteroidz_) in which you would control a spaceship that is along the bottom of the screen.  Touching either side of the screen moves the ship back and forth, where you must avoid asteroids to rack up the highest score possible.  After completing the basic features of our game, we added customization options for the spaceship as well as stars in the background to make the game a little more aesthetically pleasing.

Overall, this class was a great experience and ended up being pretty fun.  It was really cool being able to hold and play a game that we had made in our own hands.  We presented it at our end of the year project fair and _Asteroidz_ was voted second in the competition, which made us very proud of our work.
