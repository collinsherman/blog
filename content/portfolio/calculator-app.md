This project was my first GUI app that I created, all the way back in my Fundamentals of Programming II class.  We were tasked with creating a copy of the iOS calculator and were graded on functionality as well as aestic similarities.  I earned a 95/100 on the assignment, receiving full marks for aestetics, but being docked five points for my _clear_ method not working completely correct.  Nonetheless, this was a cool project because I got to see the my own hard work come to fruition in an app that I could actually use.
