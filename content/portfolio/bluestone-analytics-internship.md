I have greatly enjoyed my time with Bluestone so far.  As a smaller company, Bluestone has afforded the opportunity to be involved in a great variety of tasks.  I have gained experience in and learned basic crptography and security practices, which have proved useful.  I have also been able to work with Raspberry Pi devices.  I have become skilled in the setup and configuration of these devices to specific needs.

I have become experienced with the Suricata security framework and with this have built network security sensors for intrusion detection and prevention.  These sensors allow for remote access and monitoring of the networks to which they are connected, allowing us a real-time reactive response.

Lastly, I use the Scrapy framework to develop advanced data collection programs.  This work has proved interesting, albeit quite challenging at times, but that has kept it fresh and entertaining.  It has also given me good experience piping data into ElasticSearch as well as working with AWS.
