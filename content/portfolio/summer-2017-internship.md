My focus over this internship was centered around the development of static sites, along with some additional applications that I built.

I worked for Sherman Digital LLC, headed by my older brother.  Though this was odd at first, having my brother as a boss, we were able to get past this and have a professional relationship while on the job.  I learned a lot and was able to produce some products that impressed myself especially.  Though I am not able to share all of the work I did, a couple of sites that I worked extensively on are linked on the right of this page.

One of the other interesting applications I worked on was a web scraper.  It took a URL as a parameter and searched the site's XML for particular tags, storing the data directly into .JSON files and then turning those around and uploading the content onto another one of our sites.  This was totally ethical, as the data being searched was volunteer opportunities and they were being compiled and stored onto another site for a more central presentation, but I am not able to divulge the site at this time.

This was a great experience overall and gave me an immense amount of knowledge that has already helped me a lot.  I woudln't have been able to develop the site you're on now without this!  And I was able to gain proficiency with Git Bash and Github, which has also been extremely important.
