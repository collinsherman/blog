I worked for Sherman Digital LLC, headed by my older brother.  Though this was odd at first, having my brother as a boss, we were able to get past this and have a professional relationship while on the job.  My focus over the course of this internship was centered around the development of static sites, along with some additional applications that I built.  You can check out some of the sites to the right.

One of the more interesting applications I devloped (using Python) was a web scraper, for use with the DC Volunteer site.  It took a URL as a parameter and searched the site's XML for particular tags, storing the data directly into .JSON files and then turning those around and uploading the content onto the site.  By the end of the internship, I had created batch files that automated the whole process: they ran the scrapers, updated the files and then deployed the updated website.

Over the course of the summer, I was able to learn a great deal that has already proven immensely helpful in my school work and beyond. I woudln't have been able to develop the site you're on now without this!  Plus I was able to gain proficiency with Git Bash and Github, which has also been extremely important to my computer science endeavors.
